## Iris Flower Classification with Flask

This project demonstrates how to build a web application for Iris flower classification using Flask and a trained machine learning model.

### Project Overview

This application allows users to submit features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) of an Iris flower, and it predicts the flower species using a pre-trained model. 

**Key functionalities:**

- **User Interface:** A simple HTML form allows users to input flower features.
- **Prediction:** The Flask application receives the user input, processes it, and makes a prediction using the loaded model.
- **Response:** The predicted flower species is displayed on the screen.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pandas (optional, for model training)
- Scikit-learn (optional, for model training)
- Joblib

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification-flask.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd iris-classification-flask
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

**1. Prepare your model:**

- Replace `Cowabunga.sav` with the path to your saved model file (e.g., a pickled scikit-learn model). Ensure the model expects the same input format (4 features) as the application.

**2. Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask development server, usually accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

**3. Use the application:**

- Open the link in your web browser.
- Enter the flower's sepal and petal lengths and widths in the respective form fields.
- Click the "Predict Iris Species" button to submit the data.
- The predicted species will be displayed on the page.

### Deployment

For production deployment, consider using a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI and hosting it on a platform like Heroku or AWS. Refer to their documentation for specific instructions.

### Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and make improvements! You can contribute by:

### Additional Notes

- This is a basic example. Consider implementing error handling for invalid user input.
- You can extend this application to accept data from other sources (e.g., JSON API) or integrate visualizations.
